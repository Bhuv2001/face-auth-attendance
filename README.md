# face-auth-attendance
Face Authentication Attendance System automates attendance using facial recognition. It registers users, extracts face embeddings, and performs real-time authentication via camera input. The system supports smart punch-in/punch-out, prevents duplicate entries, logs attendance in CSV format, and is deployed as a Streamlit web app.
